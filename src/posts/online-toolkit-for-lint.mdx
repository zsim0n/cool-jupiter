> …lint was the name originally given to a particular program that flagged some suspicious and non-portable constructs (likely to be bugs) in C language source code. The term is now applied generically to tools that flag suspicious usage in software written in any computer language… — [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29)
