Lifelong learning, continuous improvements. A lot of talk about cross-functional teams and the right mix of professionals. As a professional I have a long history with skill matrices, choosing the right track in my carrier, adopting new teams or understanding team dynamics. I would like to look into this from an engineering perspective. I am running a little research to prove or disprove a few of my assumptions.

Can you help me with filling out this short survey:

I will of course publish the results. Thank you for your time.
