# Cool Jupiter: Things – Zoltansimon.me

Welcome to the repository for *Cool Jupiter: Things*, my personal Astro-powered blog hosted on [Zoltansimon.me](https://zoltansimon.me). This project uses Astro, PicoCSS, and MDX to create a minimalist and fast blog experience. The repository contains both published posts and drafts.

## 🚀 Project Structure

This project follows the [Astro project structure guidelines](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/). In addition to standard directories, there are two folders dedicated to MDX content: `posts` for published posts and `drafts` for work-in-progress posts.
